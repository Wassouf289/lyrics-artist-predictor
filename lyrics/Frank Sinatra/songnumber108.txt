The snow is snowing and the wind is blowing
But I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm
I can't remember a worst December
Just you watch those icicles fall
What do I care if those icicles fall
I've got my love to keep me warm
Off with my overcoat, off with my glove
Who needs an overcoat I'm burning with love
My heart's on fire and the fire gets higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm
