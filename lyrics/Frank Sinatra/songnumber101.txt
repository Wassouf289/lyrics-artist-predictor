Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the weary land, the weary land
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the shelter in the time of storm
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the weary land, the weary land
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, he's the shelter in the time of storm
Sometimes I feel discouraged and speak my words in vain
But then the Holy Spirit revives my soul again
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the weary land, the weary land
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, he's the shelter in the time of storm
I know I've been converted, and Lord I ain't in a chain
'Cause is my Captain, and the angels done tie my hand
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the weary land, the weary land
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the shelter in the time of storm
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the weary land, the weary land
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the shelter in the time of storm
I wanna go to heaven, Lord, I wanna go right
I know I gotta keep praying, gotta pray both day and night
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the weary land, the weary land
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the shelter in the time of storm
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, the weary land, the weary land
Jesus is a rock in the weary land, he's the shelter in the time of storm
