The moon belongs to everyone
The best things in life are free
The stars belong to everyone
They gleam there for you and for me
The flowers in spring, the robins that sing
The moonbeams that shine
They're yours, they're mine
And love can come to everyone
The best things in life are free
And love can come to everyone
The best things in life are free
