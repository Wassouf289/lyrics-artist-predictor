We might have been meant for each other
To be or not to be
Let our hearts discover
I have a feeling
It's a feeling
I'm concealing
I don't know why
It's just a mental
Incindental, sentimental alibi
But I adore you
So strong for you
Why go on stalling
I'm falling
Love is calling
Why be shy
....
Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we
Fall in love
Our hearts are made of it
Let's take a chance
Why be afraid of it
Let's close our eyes
And make our own paradise
Little we know of it
Still we can try
To make a go of it
Now we might have been meant for each other
To be or not to be
Let our hearts discover
Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we
Fall in love
Now is the time for it
While we are young
Let's fall in love
Let's fall in love
Let's fall in love
