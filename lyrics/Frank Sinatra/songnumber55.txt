I´m singing in the rain
Just singing in the rain
What a glorious feeling
And I´m happy again
I´m laughing at clouds
So dark, up above
The sun´s in my heart
And I´m ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase
Everyone from the place
Come on with the rain
I have a smile on my face
I´ll walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
Just singin', singin' in the rain
