Love and marriage, love and marriage
Go together like a horse and carriage
This I tell ya, brother, you can't have one without the other
Love and marriage, love and marriage
It's an institute you can't disparage
Ask the local gentry and they will say it's elementary
Try, try, try to separate them, it's an illusion
Try, try, try and you will only come to this conclusion:
Love and marriage, love and marriage
Go together like a horse and carriage
Dad was told by mother you can't have one
You can't have none
You can't have one without the other
Try, try, try to separate them, it's an illusion
Try, try, try and you only come to this conclusion:
Love and marriage, love and marriage
Go together like a horse and carriage
Dad was told by mother you can't have one
(You can't have none)
You can't have one without the other
