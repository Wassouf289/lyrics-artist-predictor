There are those who can leave love or take it
Love to them is just what they make it
I wish that I were the same
But love is my fav'rite game
I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard
For love to ever last
My heart should be well-schooled
'Cause I've been fooled
In the past
And still I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast
