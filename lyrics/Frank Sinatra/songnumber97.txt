On a clear day, rise and look around you
And you'll see who - just who you are
On a clear day, how it will astound you
That the glow of your being outshines every star
You feel part of every mountain, sea, and shore
You can hear from far and near a world you've never heard before
And on a clear, on that clear day
You can see forevermore

And on that-a clear, on that clear, clear day
You can see forever and ever and ever
And evermore
