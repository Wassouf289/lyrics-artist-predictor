(When you're near, the murmuring of the breeze)
(Becomes a symphony)
(A rhapsody)
And when I hear you call
So softly to me
I don't hear a call at all
I hear a rhapsody
And when your sparkling eyes
Are smiling at me
Then soft through the starlit skies
I hear a rhapsody
My days are so blue when you're away
My heart longs for you, so won't you stay?
My darling, hold me tight
And whisper to me
Then soft through the starry night
I'll hear a rhapsody
(My days are so blue when you're away)
My heart longs for you, so won't you stay?
(Forever and ever, won't you stay?)
My darling, hold me tight
And whisper to me
Then soft through a starry night
I'll hear a rhapsody
