Writer(s): Stevie Wonder
You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay (be) in my heart
I know that this is the beginning
Though I loved you for one million years
But if I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears
You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay (be) in my heart
You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue
And though I know that this is heaven
How could so much love be inside of you
You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay (be) in my heart
('Cause you are)
You are the sunshine - of my life
(Of my life, of my life)
(Light my fire baby, light my fire,...)
