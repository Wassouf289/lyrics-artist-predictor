For once in my life
I have someone who needs me
Someone I've needed so long
For once I'm afraid I can go where life leads me
And somehow know I'll be strong
For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew, someone warm like you
Would make my dreams come true
For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once I have something I know won't desert me
And I'm not alone anymore
For once I can say; this is mine you won't take it
Long as I know I have love I can make it
For once my life I have someone who needs me
For once I can say; this is mine you can't take it
Long as I know I got love I can make it
For once in my life I've got someone
Yeah, for once in my life I found someone
For once in my life, I've got someone
Who needs me
