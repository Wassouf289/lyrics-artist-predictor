(not Frank's version, this is the traditional)
On the (first) day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Twelve lords leaping, Eleven ladies dancing, Ten pipers piping
Nine drummers drumming, Eight maids milking, Seven swans swimming
Six geese laying, Five gold rings
Four calling birds, Three french hens, Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree
(this is Frank's version)
On the (first) day of Christmas, we gave our loving dad (my children gave to me)
Twelve dozen kisses, Eleven jars of jelly, Ten silken (linen) hankies
Nine games of scrabble, Eight pairs of cufflinks, Seven books of fiction
Six woolen nightshirts, Five ivory combs
Four meerschaum pipes, Three golf clubs, Two silken scarfs
And a most lovely lavender tie
