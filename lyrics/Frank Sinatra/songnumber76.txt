That old black magic has me in it's spell
That old black magic that you weave so well
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine
The same old tingle that I feel inside
And then that elevator starts it's slide
Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf that's caught in the tide
I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name, and I'm aflame
A flame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire
'cause you're the lover I have waited for
The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine
Darling, down and down I go
Round and round I go
In that spin of love that I am in
Under that old black of love
