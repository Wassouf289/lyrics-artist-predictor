I'll be loving you always
With a love that's true, always
When the things you've planned need a helping hand
I will understand always, always
Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour, not for just a day
Not for just a year, but always
Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour, not just a day
Not for just a year, but always
