BLUE SKIES
Writer(s): Irving Berlin
Blue skies, smilin' at me
Nothin' but blues skies do I see
Bluebirds singing a song
Nothin' but bluebirds all day long
Never saw the sun shinin' so bright
Never saw things goin' so right
Noticin' the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothin' but blue skies from now on
