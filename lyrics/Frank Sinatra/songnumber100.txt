Once in love with Amy, always in love with Amy
Ever and ever fascinated by her, sets your heart afire to stay
Once you're kissed by Amy, tear up your list it's Amy
Ply her with bonbons, poetry, and flowers, moon a million hours away
You might be quite the fickle-hearted rover so carefree and bold
Who loves a girl and later thinks it over and just quits cold
But once in love with Amy, always in love with Amy
Ever and ever sweetly you'll romance her, trouble is the answer will be
That Amy'd rather stay in love with me
(instrumental), always in love with Amy
Ever and ever fascinated by her, sets your heart afire to stay
(instrumental), get rid of your list it's Amy
Ply her with bonbons, poetry, and flowers, moon a million hours away
You might be quite the fickle-hearted rover so carefree and bold
Who loves a girl and later thinks it over and just quits cold
But once in love with Amy, always in love with Amy
Ever and ever sweetly you'll romance her, trouble is the answer will be
That Amy'd rather stay in love with me
