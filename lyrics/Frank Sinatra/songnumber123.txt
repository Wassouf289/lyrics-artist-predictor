I got the horse right here, the name is Paul Revere
And here's a guy that says that if all weather's clear
Can do, can do, this guy says the horse can do
If he says the horse can do, can do, can do
I picked the Valentine, cause on the Morning Line
The guy has got em figured at five to nine
But take the Epitaph, he went to buy a half
He's got it cold in here in the Telegraph
About Rivera's fight, I guess the sport's alright
Suppose it all depends if it rained last night
I know it's Valentine, the morning works were fine
You know the jockey's brother is a friend of mine
But just a minute, boys, I got the feedback's choice
It says the great grandfather was Aqua Poise
I give you Paul Revere, and it's no bum steer
It's from a man right here that's real sincere
I picked my Valentine cause on the Morning Line
The guy has got em figured at five to nine
But take the Epitaph, he went to buy a half
He's got it cold in here in the Telegraph
Epitaph, Valentine, Paul Revere, I got the horse right here
