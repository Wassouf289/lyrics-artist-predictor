I'm at a party i don't wanna be yet
And i don't ever wear a suite and tie yeah
Wondering if i could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Can you take my hand
Finish my drink say shall we dance hell yeah
You know i love you did i ever tell you
You make it better like that
Don't think i fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say
Yeah.. i always feel like i'm nobody
Who wants to fit in anyway
Cause i don't care
When i'm with my baby yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you make me feel like maybe i'm somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When i'm with my baby yeah
Cause i don't care
As long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere (take me anywhere)
And you make me feel like i'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When i'm with my baby yeah
We at a party we don't wanna be yet
Tryna talk but we can hear ourselves
Read your lips i'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But i'm told is where i'm supposed to be you know what
Is kind a crazy cause i really don't mind
You make it better like that
Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone got so much to say
When we walk in i say i'm sorry
But know i think that we should stay
Cause i don't care
When i'm with my baby yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you make me feel like maybe i'm somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When i'm with my baby yeah
Cause i don't care
As long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you make me feel like i'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights (no..oh)
When i'm with my baby yeah
I don't like nobody but you
It's like you're the only one here
I don't like nobody but you
Baby i don't care
I don't like nobody but you
I hate everyone here
I don't like nobody but you baby yeah
Cause i don't care (don't care)
When i'm with my baby yeah (oh yeah)
All the bad things disappear (disappear)
And you make me feel like maybe i'm somebody (maybe i'm somebody)
I can deal with the bad nights (with the bad nights)
When i'm with my baby yeah
Cause i don't care
As long as you just hold me near (me near)
You can take me anywhere (anywhere..anywhere)
And you make me feel like i'm loved by somebody (i'm loved by somebody)
I can deal with the bad nights
When i'm with my baby yeah
