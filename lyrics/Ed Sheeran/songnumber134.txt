Fell out of love with her
Just to trip straight back in
Times like this don’t come round here
And chances are slim
But eventually
You’ll be mine
Love stole my sympathy
When she belonged to him
But now I will feel the soft touch of her lips again
But chances are slim
But eventually
You’ll be mine
I won’t miss a thing
If you’re mine
I don’t care if you’re lost
Cause in our hearts we both know that
We both know that
All I see, is you
And I miss this
And we can't see this through
We can’t fix this
Love
It won't grow back
She said it's time for a quick cigarette by the bike shed
She asked me if I’d regret it all and I said
I replied no love this about as far as it goes
See me going by the thought of you and it shows
She said you weren’t even listening
I might be too much right now man it’s sickening
Can’t believe I’m running from her
I’m stranded, her beauty is too much to bear
And oh I think I want her
And oh I swear she’s never been deep in before
And oh I think I need her
I can’t tell her I want her it's not right in summer
I think that I need her
I won’t miss a thing
If you’re mine
I don’t care if you’re lost
Cause in our hearts we both know that
We both know that
All I see is you
And I miss this
And we can't see this through
We can’t fix this
All I see is you
And I miss this
And we can't see this through
We can’t fix this
Love, it won't grow back
Your love hit me like a punch in the nose
Baby your love deals the hardest blows
