Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk a-
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Til then I walk alone

I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams

I'm walking down the line that divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines, what's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs, to know I'm still alive and I walk alone

I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk a-
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Til then I walk alone

I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
​

I walk alone, I walk a-

I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk a-
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Til then I walk alone

I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
