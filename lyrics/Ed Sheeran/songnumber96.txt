Shock, horror, I’m down, lost, you’re not around
There’s a lump in my chest that sends cold through my head, and
My mind shuts sound out
I’m on auto-pilot, and my tongue's gone silent
Just switch it off and lay it down
Lay it down, next to you and me

I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, woah
I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss you and I miss you

These words mean nothing to me
I’m just sitting on a fence of how it used to be
These three words are aching, constrict and suffocating
My mind is racing with the picture I’m painting
And my belly’s sick to its stomach
When I remember all the times he was with you when you laid it down
When you lay down next to me

I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, woah
I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss you, more than I let on
I kissed you far too long
I’ll let go as soon as you do
See I know we’re not through

I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, woah
I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss you and I miss you

I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss you
