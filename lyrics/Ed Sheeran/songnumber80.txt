Across the sea by the Tennessee skyline
They told me I'd find my hopes and my dreams
But I long to be, in the bed of my true love
Back where I came from, she's waiting for me

So I'll make my way through long winding country roads
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

I told my dad on the phone it's amazing
From the straight to the craziest places I've seen
But I long to be, in the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother, he understands me

I spend my days, just traveling and playing shows
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

I met a man in the bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there to follow his dreams
He told me "son, you know I lost my true love
For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea"

And I found truth in people I barely know
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
