I'm filled up with doubt
I have to move home
But I want to stay with you for all of the summer
I have my plan that you won't remember
If you want to see the world, then, please, ask your mother

I cannot hold your hand to watch you go
Oh, I am a liar, as you might know

I need you now
I need your touch and your lips
I need your smile and your kiss

'Cause you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...

Hmm-hmm-hmmm-hmmmm
Hmm-hmm-hmmm-hmm

I see your voice
And from my window
When it is late at night it'll show me your shadow
I have my plan that you won't remember
If you want to see the world and, please, ask your mother
Now, ah-oh-ah-oh

I cannot hold your hand, to watch you go
Oh, I'm a liar, as you might know

I need you now
I need your touch and your lips
I need that smile and your kiss

'Cause you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
And you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
Hm, you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...

Now, these words I say mean you’re so amazing
And I've noticed lately, I need you, maybe
These words I say mean you’re so amazing
But I've noticed lately, I need you, maybe

'Cause you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
